| RQ-005         | Frontend | As an user, i would like to download back any files i want.                                                                                   | Medium     |
| RQ-006         | Frontend | As an user, i would like to be able to open the files on another page (if their type allows it) to visualize it without downloading it first. | Low        |
| RQ-007         | Backend  | As a developer, i would like to have an API that uploads files to my local directory.                                                          | Medium     |

| RQ-009         | Backend  | As a developer, i would like to have an API that lists all files from the directory.                                                          | Medium     |
| RQ-010         | Backend  | As a developer, i would like to have a filter option for the list API to filter by name, type and/or content (specific for text-based files).    | High       |
| RQ-011         | Backend  | As a developer i would like to add .rtf file to the available file type options for content search. Because this requires to strip the content first to get only the text.                                                   | Medium     |
| RQ-012         | Backend  | As a developer i would like to make sure that the folder where the files are stored exists before doing any API calls.                       | Low        |
